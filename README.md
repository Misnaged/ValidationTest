# ValidationTest

## First

After running the programm it will request to fill 2 strings in the console

First is the login ---  serega
Second - passphrase ---- aye228


## Second

If you successfuly passed login/pass 

you will need to write a transaction int.

There are only 3 valid transaction ints: 10000, 20000, 30000

You have only 3 tries to do so


## End

There are 2 cases for the programm to be automatically closed:

1. If you enter the true valid int
2. if you failed 3 attempts
